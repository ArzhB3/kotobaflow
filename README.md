# KotobaFlow (言葉フロー) <br><br>X (Twitter)/ Threads Clone in NextJS 14 with OAuth, Client & Server Components and Server Actions

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to KotobaFlow, my ongoing project that serves as a X/Threads clone, showcasing my web development skills and my commitment to providing a top-notch user experience. This project combines several technologies and frameworks to bring it to life. Here's a closer look at the project's technical stack and its various components.

## User Interface Technologies

-   **Frontend Stack:** KotobaFlow's frontend is powered by Next.js 13, utilizing TypeScript for type-safe development. The client and server components within Next.js ensure a responsive and dynamic user interface.

-   **Design and Styling:** For the design and styling, I've harnessed the power of Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. These technologies work together seamlessly to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

-   **Icon Library:** Lucide-React is integrated into KotobaFlow, providing a rich collection of icons to enhance the visual elements of the application.

-   **User Interaction:** Radix-UI components are used to create interactive and engaging elements that contribute to a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

## Data Management and Backend Technologies

-   **Server Actions:** KotobaFlow also incorporates server actions, an new technology in Next.js 14. This allows for the creation of efficient server-side logic and provides an enhanced user experience.

-   **Database Layer:** Prisma plays a crucial role in KotobaFlow by serving as the data layer, connecting the application to the database. It simplifies data operations, ensuring efficient data management.

-   **Test Data Generation:** FakerJS is employed for generating test data, facilitating the development and testing of various application features without relying on real data.

-   **Authentication and Authorization:** KotobaFlow leverages NextAuth.js for seamless authentication and authorization, enabling users to log in securely and access their accounts.

-   **Integration with Line OAuth:** An exciting feature of KotobaFlow is the integration with Line, allowing users to log in using their Line accounts, providing a convenient and secure authentication method.

## Future Enhancements

<div style="text-align: justify;">
KotobaFlow is a work in progress, and there are exciting features on the horizon. Plans include expanding the application's language support to Japanese, making it accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, I intend to implement login options for other popular social platforms like Instagram, Facebook etc..., further enhancing the application's versatility.
